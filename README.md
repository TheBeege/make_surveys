# Making Surveys

This script generates a population randomly and samples it using 4 types of sampling methods. 
This shows how the 4 different sampling methods can be different.


I will create a survey to produce population data. Questions will be written in a text file.

Each question of the survey will be in survey_questions folder.

The code of the survey has the same name as the txt file, the question that is written in natural language.

## Sampling Methods
1. SRS
2. systematic sampling
3. stratified random sampling
4. cluster random sampling
